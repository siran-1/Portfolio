                <p>
                    Before switching to a tech role, I spent two years as a <strong>Customer Service Associate</strong> at Amazon.
                    The transition to tech role was indeed hard. Multiple rejections, countless applications and over time
                    I lost track of my application's status.</p>

                <p> After two years, I was interviewed for an internal developer role in Amazon and
                    successfully (with a bit of luck) transitioned to a <strong>Full Stack Web Developer</strong> in Automation.
                    Now with over 2 years of experience in the tech field, my enthusiasm for this path continues to grow. I do struggle, sometimes even with the fundamentals (Regex?ðŸ‘€),
                    but still learning and I sure believe that learning has no end.
