                <p>
                    Before making a switch to a tech role, I spent nearly two years as a <strong>Customer Service Associate</strong>üë®üèº‚Äçüíª at Amazon. 
                    The transition to a tech role was indeed hard. Multiple rejections, countless Applications, over time 
                    I started losing the track of status of all my Applications.</p>

                <p> After two years in my Support role, I was interviewed for a internal developer role in amazon and 
                    successfully (with a bit of luck) I transitioned to the role of <strong>Full Stack Web Developer</strong> in Automation.
                    Now With over 2 years of experience in the tech field, my enthusiasm for this path continues to grow. I do struggle a lot, sometimes even with fundamentals (Regex?ü•≤), 
                    but still learning and I sure believe the learning has no end.
